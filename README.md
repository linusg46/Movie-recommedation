# Movie Recommedation system
## Business Understanding
### Introduction<br>
A movie recommendation aims to anticipate or filter preferences in line with the user's  movie selections.it predicts the ratings for movies users havenâ€™t watched yet. Movies are then indexed and suggested to users based on these predicted ratings.The Stakeholders is Netflix Company which is a a streaming service that provides thousands of internet-connected devices with access to a large selection of award-winning TV series, films, animation, documentaries, and more.

Netflix's mission is to entertain the world, demonstrating its dedication to producing high-quality video content and providing world-class entertainment services for users.Netflix vision statement is becoming the best global entertainment distribution service and this can be achieved by user retention and engagement on the streaming platform by offering users individualized movie suggestions.This will be achieved by creating a recommender system.

<br> 
The users are classified into 3 groups:

- New users are those who have just joined the site and have never interacted before.
- Users that periodically watch movies but haven't developed firm tastes are referred to as casual users.
- Users that often view movies and have clear preferences for genres are known as enthusiast users.
<br>

### Problem statement
naccurate recommedations given to users by different platforms,thus users are forced to take more time in searching for other similar movies which will fit their tastes and prefrences.This may also lead to the users changing to other platforms

### Defining Metrics of Success
The success of the movie recommedation model will be evaluated based on its ability to provide accurate movie recommedation to users based on the ratings of previous movies,which may fall under the same genre or are similar to .

### Research Questions
- What can be done to improve collaborative filtering models so that movie recommendations are more accurate?<br>
- What are the best ways to optimize hybrid models for movie recommendation?<br>
- How can collaborative filtering algorithms offer consumers recommendations that are easy to understand, and how does explainability impact user happiness and trust?

### Main Objective
- To provide customers with tailored movie recommendations based on their preferences and tastes , so i may enhance the average amount of time they spend on your site.This lead to increase to the amount of revenue generated by the Netflix platform

### Specific Objectives
 To Boost Recommendation Accuracy by cutting down on user preference prediction errors.<br>
- To Provide accurate recommendations to new users or items with little interaction history to solve the cold start problem.<br>
- To Make sure the collaborative filtering approach can effectively handle huge user and item databases to maximize scalability and efficiency.

## Data Understanding
We will be using the MovieLens dataset for this purpose. It has been collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. MovieLens 100K dataset can be downloaded from http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/. It consists of:

- 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
- Each user has rated at least 20 movies.
It contains the following columns:

1. <b>UserId</b> :Typically, the terms "user ID" or "user identifier" refer to a special alphanumeric code or string assigned to a certain user. One user can be distinguished from another using it.The dataset has 610 users.

2. <b>MovieId</b>:Typically, "movie ID" refers to a specific movie's allocated unique identifier within a database for identification purposes.The dataset has 9477 different movies

3. <b>Title</b>: This simply the names of the different movies

4. <b>Timestamp</b>:Timestamps are frequently used to record and track events, transactions, and data changes in a variety of contexts and applications, particularly in computing and data management.

5. <b>Genre</b>: This column contains the type of movies that is ,thriller,fantasy,diction,comedy,drama,sci_fi and many others.

6. <b>Rating</b>:This is a range of 1-5 used by users to show the extent at which they liked or disliked a particular movie .

## Importing necessary libraries
The required Python libraries are imported to perform data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, and building predictive models. The libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn modules, and more.

## Reading into the data
The dataset is loaded using pandas, and the first few rows are displayed to get a glimpse of the data's structure.

## Data Wrangling
Before applying machine learning models, the dataset underwent a thorough data wrangling process to ensure its quality and compatibility. This process included steps such as:

<br>Handling Missing Values:</br> The dataset did not have any missing values.

<br>Handling Duplicate Entries: </br> Duplicate rows were found ,but interestingly the duplicate rows were unique entries but were duplicates because they shared a common user/rating.

<br>Outlier Handling: </br>Outliers, which could affect the model's performance, were identified and removed.

## Modeling
1.<br>Collaborative filtering model(user_item_matrix)</br>-It represents the interactions or preferences of users for items in a matrix format, where rows correspond to users, columns correspond to items, and the entries in the matrix represent user-item interactions or ratings

2.<br>SVD</br>SVD decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, which together capture the essential information and relationships within the original matrix.

## Conclusion
In summary, customers' experiences watching movies could be greatly improved by the creation and application of a movie recommendation model. Such a model may precisely forecast and suggest movies that match users' preferences and interests by utilizing cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and data analysis approaches.Users can find new films through this methodology that they might not have otherwise seen, making for a more interesting and entertaining cinematic trip. 

## Recommedations
- By enabling users to share their recommendations and ratings with others, the approach can also promote a sense of community and involvement, making movie watching more engaging and sociable.<br>
- Recommedation models should try to avoid The "filter bubble" effect, in which viewers are only exposed to content that confirms their previous inclinations, could offer difficulties for it by potentially limiting their exposure to a range of cinematic experiences. <br>
- Collecting and use of personal data can create ethical and privacy problems, user privacy and data security should be the top priorities when implementing such a model.
- The development and implementation of movie recommendation models must be done responsibly, with careful consideration of user privacy and a commitment to promote a variety of cinematic experiences. Movie recommendation models have the potential to revolutionize how we discover and enjoy movies.
